#' Get USDA data
#'
#' @description Downloads a zip file containing a csv from the USDA website, imports it, cleans it and write two new csvs: USDA-tidy.csv containing a tidy dataframe of the data, and USDA-flowsheets.csv containing flowsheet info for the last five years, for importing into Excel.
#' @param url Should be a link to the most recent USDA coffee \strong{zip file}.
#'
#' @return Also returns a dataframe called usda, which is loaded from the usda-tidy.csv using loadUSDA() under the hood.
#' @export

#' @examples getUSDA()
